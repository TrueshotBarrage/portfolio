        <p>
          The word <strong>"gospel"</strong> means <em>good news</em>. But what is this news, 
          and why does it matter?
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Every person has sinned and fallen short of God's perfect standard. Sin separates 
          us from God and leads to death—not just physical, but spiritual and eternal.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
          <cite>— Romans 3:23</cite>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          God, in His great love, sent His Son Jesus Christ into the world. Jesus lived 
          a perfect life, died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, and rose 
          again on the third day—victorious over sin, death, and all his enemies.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes 
          in him should not perish but have eternal life."
          <cite>— John 3:16</cite>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Promise</h2>
        <p>
          For those who believe in Jesus and trust in His finished work, there is now 
          <strong>no condemnation</strong>. We are forgiven, adopted as children of God, 
          and promised everlasting joy in His presence.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
          <cite>— Romans 8:1</cite>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Invitation</h2>
        <p>
          This gift is freely offered to all who will receive it by faith. It cannot be 
          earned—only accepted with a humble and repentant heart.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart 
          that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
          <cite>— Romans 10:9</cite>
